Felix being one of the earliest to arrive at class that day â€“ he saw this stunning lady locked outside the room. It happened this stunning lady, Yanni had left her access card at home. This lad hold on to the chance and saved the day by opening the door for her.

      %p Felixâ€™s lovely hometown, Kota Kinabalu â€“ or as the locals call it, KK.
      %p.self-statement Pronounced as kay-kay. 

      %p Kota Kinabalu wonâ€™t immediately overwhelm you with its beauty, but youâ€™ll soon notice its friendly locals, breathtaking fiery sunsets, blossoming arts and music scene, and rich culinary spectrum spanning Malay to Japanese, Western to Cantonese, street food to high end.
      %p.self-statement I didn't come up with this â€“Â it's a snippet from Lonely Planet.

      %p As lovely as KK sounds, sadly, there are no direct flights from Brisbane to the city. We have suggested some airlines here, simply click on the airline logo to go to their website. Flight Centre has good deals too.
      %p.self-statement Disclaimer, we are in no way affiliated with the suggested airlines, or Flight Centre. It is purely a suggestion, feel free to choose any airline of your liking. 

      %p We, the wedding couple will be in KK from the 23 June till the 3 July. Please do let the couple know if you are around for a catch-up!
      %p.self-statement We promise to do our best to make time!
